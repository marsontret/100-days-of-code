# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>: Started working through Free Code Campâ€™s Front End Certification Projects. I've finished 23 challenges so far.

I've also spent the last 3 days learning about git and github. On the recommentdation of @TheCooperMan (https://github.com/TheCooperMan) I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9fIBT2NBGY. I actually did pretty much everything @ssaunier (https://github.com/ssaunier) did in the video rather than just watching.

<b>Thoughts</b>: I learned a few new interesting things particully about CSS, but although I'm excited about this journey I've started, as usaul I'm worried I will forget what I've learned just as quickly.

Putting that aside, what I've taken away most from these first few days is that the actual writing of code is only one task in series of potential tasks required in development: version control being another.

Looking forward to day 2!

### Day 2: January 2, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>: I'm now on challenge 56, which is about using hex for colors.

I'm continuing to use Git from the bash command line (in VS Code) to update my log. Yesterday, I when I tried to commit my changed it opened up Vi editor and I tried just issuing the SHIFT+ZZ command to save and quit but I got an error. I then had to run 'git commit' again to finish the commit but there was a duplicate file, which I had to delete.

I then realised I had merged changes into the local master branch of the repository, and that the remote master branch (origin) was behind. 'git push origin master' resolved that.

It seems I should have pushed the child branch I made the changes in to origin, merged it into the master branch on GitHub and then pulled origin back to local master. (Feel free to comment this log. I'm keen on getting the nomenclature and process right.)

<b>Thoughts</b>: After looking at the amount of challenges to get through, I'm pushing myself to finish 'Basic JavaScript' by the end of January. On an hour/day basis that should mean 73 days (remaining). I'm going start to 'Basic JavaScript' in 31 days!

### Day 3: January 3, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>: I'm now on challenge 92 - the start of the jQuery challenges.

<b>Thoughts</b>: I'm looking forward to doing the jQuery work. I'm happy with my progress. So far I haven't found the challenges particularly difficult, but they have definitely engaged me. I'm happy with my current rate.

I was struggling with naming my branches and concluded I would use the R<round_number>D<day_number> format everyday when I update my logs. I then remembered ssaunier saying that a good approach is one branch/feature. So, rather than using the format above I will use something that meaningfully describes what I'm doing - and just for the practice, I will only focus on making changes specific to the branch. However, for general progress updates I will use: R<round_number>D<day_number>-LogUpdate.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>: I'm now on challenge 105 doing more jQuery.

<b>Thoughts</b>: jQuery is amazing! But then I may just be easily pleased. Looking forward to learning more.

### Day 5: January 5, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>:I'm now on challenge 111: 'Build a Tribute Page'.

<b>Thoughts</b>: I feel like I've already forgotten what I've learned! So far I don't even know where to start. Tommorrow I'll just start with a heading, and image and an unordered list - relatively simple HTML stuff. Then I will add Bootstrap elements and flesh it out.

### Day 6: January 6, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>:I have started the 'Build a Tribute Page' challenge and have added an html outline on codepen.io.

<b>Thoughts</b>: The most important thing I learned today was how keeping the initial requirements simple is important. I added a set of requirements to the 2 user stories given in the challenge, but then I realised I was being unnecessarily specific and that the detail was more a hindrance than a help at this point. Therefore, I've focussed on an outline that meets the 2 user stories. Once I've done this I will flesh out the page with some as I see fit.

### Day 7: January 7, 2018

<b>Today's Progress</b>:I continued the 'Build a Tribute Page' challenge.

<b>Thoughts</b>: Forgot everything! I ran through freeCodeCamp challenges pretty fast up to this point but putting things into practice is proving somewhat difficult. There is some knowledge on the basics of page layout that I'm missing but I'm slowly picking up.
